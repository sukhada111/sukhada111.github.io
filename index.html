    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p class="content">Hello there! I'm a technology enthusiast with a passion for Data Science and AI. I enjoy building Machine Learning models and deriving interesting insights from big data. As a Data Scientist at Data Axle for the last 2 years, I explored cutting-edge tech stack such as PySpark, Python's ML libraries to develop ML solutions and leveraged Kedro, Airflow, Databricks software to develop modular pipelines and deploy them in Cloud based environments such as AWS.
                <br><br>
                 I hail from Mumbai, India where I did my undergrad with B.Tech IT from University of Mumbai. During my engineering, I worked on web development projects such as building E-commerce applications, healthcare portals using Django/PHP for backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap for frontend.
                 <br><br>
                 On a more Personal note, I love watching movies, dancing to Bollywood songs and I'm also a huge Taylor Swift fan (or, swiftie as we call us!). Recently, I moved to Austin, US to pursue MSITM program at the University of Texas at Austin. Through this program, I aspire to secure senior data-oriented roles and explore Product Management as well.</p>
